Basics of digital image processing and analysis; introduction to classical mathematical tools for digital image representation.

### _Course description_ :

This course covers the basics of digital image processing and analysis:
   - image acquisition chain and digital camera (optics, sampling, noise, radiometry, color),
   - image restoration and enhancement (denoising, inverse problems and deconvolution, super-resolution, inpainting, etc.),
   - image analysis (differential operators, segmentation, local descriptors, texture, shape representation),  
   
And introduces classic mathematical tools for digital image representation; all these tools have the distinctive feature of offering image representation at several scales (several levels of detail):  
  - multi-scale Gaussian and Laplacian representation, variants,
  - wavelet decomposition,
  - discrete representations,
  - mathematical morphology.
